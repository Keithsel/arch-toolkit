Some utilities for Arch Linux maintenance

## Note

- Some tracking tools exports data to markdown files intended to be used with Obsidian, so it is recommended to use Obsidian to view the data. You can use any markdown viewer, but Obsidian provides the ability to view links (wrapped in `[[ ]]`).

- This is a collection of tools that I use to maintain my Arch Linux system, and it may not be suitable for everyone. Use at your own risk.

## Tools included

- `package-tracker`: Track explicitly installed packages with the ability to create a custom baseline and commit changes.
- `service-mapper`: Map services provided by explicitly installed packages to a markdown file.
- `backup`: Backup tool using rsync with exclusions and logging capabilities.

## TODO

- Nerd font patcher
